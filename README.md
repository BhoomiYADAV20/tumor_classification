This project focuses on Brain Tumor MRI Image Classification using Deep Learning techniques. It aims to classify MRI brain images into four categories: Glioma Tumor, Meningioma Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning with ResNet50, the model assists in automatic brain tumor detection from MRI scansâ€”providing a reliable tool for healthcare professionals.

The dataset used consists of thousands of MRI images across the four classes and was preprocessed by resizing to 150x150 pixels and applying normalization. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming were applied to improve generalization. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets.

Two models were developed. The first is a custom CNN model that uses multiple convolutional layers with dropout and max pooling. The second and more powerful model uses the ResNet50 architecture with pre-trained ImageNet weights, and customized dense layers for multi-class classification. The ResNet50 model achieved a validation accuracy of over 96% with excellent generalization, outperforming the basic CNN model.

Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was also performed. Visualizations included class distribution, image size and dimensions analysis, image samples, and performance metrics such as confusion matrix and precision-recall-F1 bar plots. Furthermore, three statistical hypothesis tests were conducted: a t-test to compare pixel intensity between tumor and non-tumor images, a Chi-square test to determine the association between tumor type and image brightness level, and an ANOVA test to analyze whether average file size differs significantly across tumor types. All tests confirmed meaningful differences and supported our modeling assumptions.

A Streamlit web application was developed for easy deployment. The app allows users to upload MRI images and instantly receive classification results with confidence scores. It also displays the uploaded image as preview. This real-time interface demonstrates the practical utility of the model for clinical or educational use.

The entire project was implemented using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Streamlit. The model files, dataset folder structure, and app code are organized and ready to run. A requirements.txt file is included for easy setup.

In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates how deep learning can be used to detect brain tumors from MRI scans with high accuracy and reliability. The tool has the potential to support radiologists, particularly in regions with limited access to diagnostic services. Future improvements include adding Grad-CAM visual explanations, ROC AUC analysis, and REST API integration for broader deployment.
